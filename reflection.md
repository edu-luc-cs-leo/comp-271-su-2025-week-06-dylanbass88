# Reflection - COMP 271 WEEK 06

This week I worked on finishing the Stack and Queue classes. I had to use the DynamicArray class we already made, and then write new methods that followed the rules for stacks (LIFO) and queues (FIFO). I learned how to make push() add to the front for a stack and add() go to the back for a queue. I also figured out how to remove the first item using pop().
When I looked at the example code from before, I noticed some things I got right like resizing and checking for null. But I also missed stuff like reusing code and making methods simpler. It helped to see the correct way to do it and learn from that.
I started a bit earlier this time and that made it easier to finish. I want to keep doing that for the last assignment. I also need to make sure I test the code before turning it in, just to be sure everything works.
